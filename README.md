# Introduction
For Javascript I'm going to use this book its free here on its official site: https://eloquentjavascript.net/. I've always used this book, as kind of my reference when it comes to Javascript so I find it pretty useful.
This is probably going to start off chaotic but hopefully gets better as we go on. So let me know if you have a question on **anything**. I'm going to start from the basics. But tbh we're going to use Typescript as it makes working with Javascript a lot easier, and it dosen't require much time to pick up. It pretty much is kinda of like Javascript 2.0. It's main thing is it lets you give variables a type in Javascript because namely. This helps with fixing errors because Javascript normally does not have typing so when it spits out errors they're so ambiguous. ITS THE WORST.
